 ## Welp

It feels wierd to go back and use github. This site is probally going to be the base for some sort of web based chat client, probally used by people to chat online and without anyone else nowing. I will have to find a way to maks the packets and how they are sent so to stop people tracing the use of this. 

### Even if...

... I cant do it, it will still  be a useable resourse for people.
